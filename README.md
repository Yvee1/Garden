This repository has perished but a [park](https://github.com/Yvee1/Park) has risen up from its ashes.

A to be collection of trees.
List of possible interesting trees to plant:
* Data visualization trees
  * ~~Traditional Pythagoras tree~~  p5.js
  * Generalized Pythagoras tree
* Data structures
  * Binary trees
    * ~~Traditional binary tree~~    d3.js TODO: better layout + stability
    * Red-black tree
      * Traditional
      * Augmented
    * AVL trees
  * Space paritioning trees
    * K-d tree
    * Quad-tree
  * Heap
  * Trie
* Minimum spanning trees
  * ~~Prim's algorithm~~ sigma.js TODO: step-by-step visualisation
